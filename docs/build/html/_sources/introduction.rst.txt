The image-processing module incorporate essential procedures to prepare remote sensing images mostly for automatic classification methods, in this case specifically, deep-learning approaches.

Beyond the routines, three main methods have been developed: image tiling, vector tiling, annotation images preparation, among other independent preprocessing procedures (available in `/scripts` - in `bash`).

**All modules available here are under construction. Therefore, many errors and malfunctions can occur for your specific needs.**
